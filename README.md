/*
 * This code helps the user to find the number of individual faces of an n-Simplex when 
 * the dimension of the simplex is given as the input
 */
/*
 * This program can handle an input of range 0 to 100.The variables in the program are type casted
 * in such a way.
 */
/*
 * Any input out this range is considerd as an illegal entry and the code loops it self back
